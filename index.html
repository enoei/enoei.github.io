<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    The goal of my research at the University of Toronto is to mobilize, translate, and innovate data-driven knowledge for software developers and engineers. We develop methods and tools for enhancing software development processes in order to effectively amplify development productivity. These methods and tools get validated through case studies with several partner organizations including industry partners and Canadian research networks.
    Our research is funded by the <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/RPP-PP/NSERCANR-CRSNGANR_eng.asp">NSERC Strategic Partnership</a>.
    Also, we are in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, <a href="https://www.csc.uvic.ca/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, and <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.
