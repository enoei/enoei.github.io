<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    The goal of our research at the University of Toronto is to mobilize, translate, and innovate data-driven knowledge. We develop methods and tools for analyzing and enhancing the data sets through which software engineers and developers collaborate; therefore, we can effectively amplify their productivity. These methods and tools get validated through case studies with several partner organizations including industry partners and Canadian research networks.
    Our research is funded by the <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/RPP-PP/NSERCANR-CRSNGANR_eng.asp">NSERC Strategic Partnership</a>.
    Also, we are in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, <a href="https://www.csc.uvic.ca/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, and <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.
